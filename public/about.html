                <p>Welcome to The Miyen Group LLC, where we believe in providing you with a healthier and more nutritious alternative to the African foods we all know and love. We understand that many of us often opt for foods that are less harmful or simply fill our bellies, without considering the essential nutrients our bodies need to thrive. This often leads to a lack of vitamins and minerals, resulting in minor or serious illnesses and even obesity.</p> <br> <br>
              
                <p>At The Miyen Group LLC, we aim to change that narrative. Our flagship product, the Miyen Nuden Poundo, is not just a safer option than other poundos, swallows, or fufus out thereâ€”it's a superfood that will fill your body with goodness and important nutrients, making you healthier and stronger. Our poundo is made from flour derived from 10 carefully selected organic, ancient grains, root vegetables, and psyllium husk, each ingredient bringing different essential vitamins and minerals to the table.</p> <br>
              
                <p>But what exactly are ancient grains? Ancient grains are a category of grains and pseudo-grains that have been cultivated for thousands of years, remaining largely unchanged by modern selective breeding techniques. These grains retain their unique flavors, nutritional profiles, and benefits. Compared to modern and refined grains, ancient grains are more nutrient-dense, rich in dietary fiber, vitamins (such as B vitamins and vitamin E), minerals (including magnesium, iron, and zinc), and antioxidants. They play crucial roles in various bodily functions, including energy production, immune function, and cell health. Additionally, ancient grains can grow properly without the aid of synthetic fertilizers due to their genetic adaptabilities and deep root systems.</p> <br>
              
                <p>In addition to ancient grains, our poundo incorporates vegetable roots, which are vegetables that grow underground and have edible roots or tubers. These root vegetables store energy and nutrients in their roots, making them rich sources of carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</p> <br>
              
                <p>Let's delve into the ingredients that make up our Organic Nuden Poundo:</p> <br>
              
                <h2>Ancient Grains Flours:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Khorasan:</strong> Also known as Kamut, this nutritious wheat variety is a good source of protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It promotes better digestion, brain function, provides energy, and is rich in antioxidants.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Spelt:</strong> Another wholesome wheat variety, spelt is rich in micronutrients, offering several health benefits such as improving heart health and reducing bloating.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Buckwheat:</strong> A gluten-free ancient grain-like seed, buckwheat is packed with essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It helps improve blood cholesterol levels, reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and obesity.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Barley:</strong> This nutrient-dense grain is a good source of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber known as beta-glucan. It plays a significant role in fighting insulin resistance, cancer, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Amaranth:</strong> Another gluten-free ancient grain-like seed, amaranth is highly nutritious and rich in phosphorus, iron, and antioxidants. It supports brain function, bone health, blood production, and may reduce inflammation.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sorghum:</strong> A nutrient-rich, gluten-free cereal grain, sorghum contains vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds that act as antioxidants. It promotes gut health and has anti-cancer effects.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Chickpea:</strong> Also known as garbanzo beans, chickpeas are an excellent source of plant-based protein, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. They support digestion, regulate blood sugar levels, aid in weight management, and contribute to fetal development during pregnancy.
                  </li> <br>
                </ul>
              
                <h2>Root Vegetables:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Potato flour:</strong> Made from dried potatoes, potato flour is gluten-free and rich in dietary fiber. It aids digestion, promotes regular bowel movements, and supports gut health. It also contains vitamins and minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Arrowroot powder:</strong> Derived from the arrowroot plant, this root vegetable is a source of protein and several minerals. It supports the immune system, aids weight loss, and provides essential folate for development during pregnancy.
                  </li> <br>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Psyllium Husk:</strong> This dietary fiber is derived from the outer coating of Plantago ovata seeds. It is commonly used as a natural remedy for digestive issues and as a dietary supplement. Psyllium husk is low in carbs and calories, rich in minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and has prebiotic effects.
                  </li> <br>
                </ul>
              
                <p>We take pride in using only organic ingredients, ensuring that the grains are whole grains and that every component is sourced and handled with the utmost care to retain its nutrients and goodness.</p> <br>
